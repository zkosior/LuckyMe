Lucky me
Dr. Stevens was not only a great physicist; he was also a very superstitious one. He
wondered if there is a reason for his bad luck, an ultimate answer to all of his life questions.

He decided to check the underlying structure of the world around him. Being familiar with
many large numbers – the number of stars in a galaxy, number of particles in a human body,
the number of atoms in the whole Universe and whatnot – he started to suspect that some
of them might be simply divisible by the most unlucky number of them all – thirteen.

Here’s where you come in. Write a program that, for a given set of positive integers returns
a series of Yes or No, depending on whether the given number is divisible by 13 or not.

The input will consist of a series of numbers, each in a separate line. The output should also
be a series of either Yes or No, each in a separate line. The input numbers can be quite large,
meaning they could range from 1 to 10310.

Sample input:

17
19186648
1192533292512492016559195008117
5962666462562460082795975040588

Sample output:

No
Yes
Yes
